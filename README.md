# KernelTerminal
A lightweight C# library that uses native interop to manage a console window. It can be useful when you need a console in a non-console application - for anything: logging, manipulation, etc. It allows you to open the console whenever you want and use it however you want!

You can also use it if you want to get around any wrappers (like Windows Terminal) or make the opened console a main application. To do it, you need to create a console project, then hop into the project properties -> Output type and select "Windows application" instead of "Console application". Then simply call `Terminal.Open` at the beginning of the Main method.

## Known Issue
If you opened the console window as seconadry window of an application and the console is closed manually or its process is terminated (e.g., through Task Manager), 
the **main application thread is also terminated** ([Media](Media/closeissue.gif)). This happens because the console process is linked to the main application thread, and closing it forces the entire application to stop.
To avoid this, **do not close the console manually** â€” use `Terminal.Close()` instead.

## Styles
KernelTerminal supports different window styles meaning that you can hide the buttons and the process of the console in the taskbar.

In code, there is `WindowStyle` enum to manage it:
```csharp
Terminal.Open(WindowStyle.Default);
Terminal.Open(WindowStyle.ButtonsHidden); 
Terminal.Open(WindowStyle.ProcessHidden);
Terminal.Open(WindowStyle.ButtonsHidden | WindowStyle.ProcessHidden);
```
